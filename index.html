                This Narrative Vizualization's main objective is to better understand trends in COVID 19 Cases throughout the pandemic in the United States, 
                starting near very beginning of the pandemic and going through major developments like introduction of new variants, and the initial vaccine rollout. 
                The Narrative Vizualization uses Cumulative Cases recorded for each of the dates to better understand the rate of change between dates.
